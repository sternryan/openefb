A free, open-source iPad VFR Electronic Flight Bag that combines moving-map navigation with flight recording and AI-powered post-flight debrief.

## The Problem

ForeFlight costs $120-360/yr. Every data source it uses -- FAA airports, VFR sectional charts, NOAA weather -- is **free and public domain**. Android pilots have Avare (free, open-source). iOS pilots have nothing. OpenEFB fills that gap.

## What Makes It Different

1. **Open-source and free** -- all flight-critical features, forever
2. **Simplicity-first** -- VFR-focused, not an IFR app with VFR bolted on
3. **Integrated flight recording** -- GPS track + cockpit audio + radio transcription, built into the EFB
4. **AI-powered debrief** -- post-flight analysis with radio phraseology scoring and key-moment identification

## Features

**Navigation**
- Moving map with VFR sectional chart overlays (FAA GeoTIFFs)
- Full US airport database (~20,000 airports) with spatial search
- Airport info sheets (runways, frequencies, weather)
- GPS ownship tracking with instrument strip (GS, ALT, VSI, TRK)

**Weather**
- METAR/TAF display with flight category color coding (VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR)
- Weather map dots across all visible airports
- Real-time NOAA Aviation Weather API integration

**Flight Planning**
- Departure to destination route planning with map overlay
- Nearest airport emergency feature
- Aircraft and pilot profiles
- Chart download manager with offline support

**Complete Offline Operation**
- All aviation data cached locally
- VFR sectional charts stored as MBTiles
- No network required after initial data download

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Platform | iPad, iOS 26.0 |
| Language | Swift 5.0+, SwiftUI |
| Architecture | MVVM + Combine |
| Map Engine | MapLibre Native iOS (open-source, no API fees) |
| Aviation Data | SwiftNASR (FAA NASR -- 20K US airports) |
| Database | GRDB (aviation data, R-tree spatial indexes) + SwiftData (user data) |
| Weather | NOAA Aviation Weather API (free, no key required) |
| Charts | FAA VFR Sectional GeoTIFFs converted to MBTiles |
