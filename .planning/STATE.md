# Project State

## ⚠ RECONCILIATION NOTE (2026-08-14 squawk pass)

The old frontmatter/body said Phase 06 was "EXECUTING" with plan 3 of 3 in progress (20/21
plans complete). Verified against `.planning/phases/06-polish-testflight/` (06-01-SUMMARY.md,
06-02-SUMMARY.md, and **06-03-SUMMARY.md all exist**) and `.planning/ROADMAP.md`'s own Phase 6
checklist (06-01/02/03 all `[x]`): Phase 6, plan 3 (onboarding + TestFlight prep) is complete.
That closes v1.0 at 21/21 plans, 6/6 phases. Git log confirms follow-on work after 06-03
(TestFlight submission prep docs, gitignore, a type-check timeout fix) with no new GSD phase
opened — the milestone itself has no separate MILESTONE-AUDIT doc in `.planning/milestones/`,
so "v1.0 complete" here reflects the phase checklist, not a formal audit sign-off. Phase 999.1
(ADS-B In, backlog) remains not started, as before.

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** A pilot can install the app, fly with it as their primary EFB, record their flight, and get an AI debrief afterward — all free, all on-device, no account required.
**Current focus:** v1.0 complete (Phase 06 polish-testflight closed out)

## Current Position

Phase: 06 (polish-testflight) — Complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Fresh start over refactor — 60%+ of existing code needed rewriting; iOS 26 @Observable changes app layer fundamentally
- [Init]: SFR as recording spec (design knowledge), not importable code — SFR targets iOS 17/Core Data, incompatible concurrency model
- [Init]: Bundle SQLite (20K airports) rather than SwiftNASR on-device parsing — faster launch, works offline immediately
- [Init]: Foundation Models only (no Claude API) for v1 — validate on-device debrief quality before adding cloud tier
- [Init]: Chart CDN (Cloudflare R2 + server-side GDAL pipeline) is Phase 1 critical path — must be operational before Phase 1 can be verified
- [Phase 01]: Used @Observable macro (not ObservableObject) for AppState root state coordinator
- [Phase 01]: Archived 49 old ObservableObject files to _archive/ (outside build), preserving as reference
- [Phase 01]: Info.plist at project root to avoid PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup conflict
- [Phase 01]: AviationDatabase uses DatabasePool (not DatabaseQueue) for concurrent reads with WAL mode
- [Phase 01]: Seed database (522 airports) for Phase 1; full 20K NASR import deferred to future iteration
- [Phase 01]: Copy-on-first-launch to Application Support/efb-212/ subdirectory for write access
- [Phase 01]: MapService runs on MainActor (not actor) because MLNMapView is UIKit main-thread-only
- [Phase 01]: Used SQLite3 C API directly for MBTiles metadata read to avoid GRDB dependency in MapService
- [Phase 01]: Ownship chevron rendered programmatically via UIGraphicsImageRenderer (32pt blue triangle)
- [Phase 01]: Direct-to sets activeFlightPlan=true and computes DTG/ETE from ownship position and ground speed
- [Phase 01]: NearestAirportViewModel skips DB query when ownship moves <0.5 NM to avoid excessive R-tree queries
- [Phase 01]: WeatherService as actor with nonisolated static constants for thread-safe cache
- [Phase 01]: MapService.updateWeatherDots accepts stationCoordinates dict for airport-correlated weather positions
- [Phase 01]: TFR service ships with 5 hardcoded sample TFRs and TFR_DATA_IS_SAMPLE disclaimer flag
- [Phase 01]: SearchBar collapses behind magnifying glass toggle to maximize map area
- [Phase 01]: Services initialized lazily in MapContainerView.onAppear, GPS only active on map tab
- [Phase 01]: Used OurAirports CSV for 25K+ US airports (FAA-derived, simpler than NASR fixed-width)
- [Phase 01]: Included heliports (8K) alongside airports/seaplane bases to exceed 20K target
- [Phase 02]: CurrencyService as struct with static methods -- pure functions, no actor isolation needed
- [Phase 02]: JSON-encoded Data columns for VSpeeds/NightLandingEntries -- avoids SwiftData relationship complexity
- [Phase 02]: Test host guard via NSClassFromString(XCTestCase) to skip MapLibre init during testing
- [Phase 02]: Disabled 7 pre-existing broken test files (API drift from Phase 1 refactoring)
- [Phase 02]: ViewModel as optional @State initialized in onAppear for Environment dependency access
- [Phase 02]: Tab currency badge counts non-current statuses via direct SwiftData fetch + CurrencyService in ContentView
- [Phase 02]: CurrencyBadge includes status text alongside color dot for accessibility
- [Phase 02]: Cross-tab service sharing via AppState (sharedDatabaseService, sharedMapService) for Flights tab to access Map services
- [Phase 02]: Concrete DatabaseManager fallback in FlightPlanView when shared service is nil (no PlaceholderDatabaseService)
- [Phase 03]: RecordingCoordinator.State uses nonisolated init() with @unchecked Sendable for actor-MainActor bridging
- [Phase 03]: Single recording.sqlite database with flightID foreign key (not per-flight databases)
- [Phase 03]: FlightPhaseDetector as struct (pure-function state machine, no actor isolation needed)
- [Phase 03]: Placeholder implementations for AudioRecorder/TranscriptionService for independent Plan 02/03 development
- [Phase 03]: AVAudioEngine exclusively (not AVAudioRecorder) for dual-output: file write + buffer streaming
- [Phase 03]: Actor setter methods for cross-actor callback wiring (setOnBufferAvailable, setOnInterruptionGap)
- [Phase 03]: didBecomeActive fallback for interruptions without end notification (Apple docs: not guaranteed)
- [Phase 03]: Gap markers stored as TranscriptSegmentRecord with [INTERRUPTION: reason] text
- [Phase 04]: nonisolated static for pure-function duration formatting on @MainActor LogbookViewModel
- [Phase 04]: RecordingViewModel uses optional logbookViewModel/modelContext injection for loose coupling
- [Phase 04]: Confirmed logbook entries open in read-only mode (isConfirmed controls navigation behavior)
- [Phase 04]: PhaseObservation Codable conformance added for JSON encoding in DebriefRecord
- [Phase 04]: Delete-then-insert for debrief regeneration overwrite (GRDB INSERT OR REPLACE only works on primary key)
- [Phase 04]: Raw SQL for debrief insert to match existing RecordingDatabase UUID-as-string encoding pattern
- [Phase 04]: Temp files for GRDB test databases (DatabasePool requires real file paths, not :memory:)
- [Phase 04]: Shared RecordingDatabase via AppState.getOrCreateRecordingDatabase() -- avoids per-view database instance creation
- [Phase 04]: CurrencyWarningBanner auto-computes on appear, dismissed per-session via AppState flag
- [Phase 04]: PartiallyGenerated array elements non-optional -- direct rendering without unwrapping
- [Phase 05]: PhaseMarkerFraction struct instead of tuple array for @Observable compatibility
- [Phase 05]: Fixed GRDB UUID BLOB/TEXT mismatch: Column(flightID) == flightID instead of .uuidString
- [Phase 05]: Replay layers added on-demand via addReplayLayers, not in onStyleLoaded
- [Phase 05]: testTick() bypasses isPlaying guard for deterministic unit testing
- [Phase 05]: VStack segmented picker above FlightPlanView/FlightHistoryListView to avoid nested NavigationStack conflict
- [Phase 05]: Separate MLNMapView instance for ReplayMapView to prevent replay layers polluting live navigation map
- [Phase 05]: Exposed trackPoints/transcriptSegments as private(set) on ReplayEngine for UI view access
- [Phase 06]: @AppStorage for beta banner dismissal instead of SwiftData -- simpler for single boolean flag
- [Phase 06]: Weather age badge in LayerControlsView under Weather toggle -- map GeoJSON dots cannot host SwiftUI views
- [Phase 06]: File-system path approach (#filePath) for test access to PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy since test host does not bundle xcprivacy into test target

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1 blocker]: Chart CDN infrastructure (GeoTIFF → MBTiles → Cloudflare R2) is external to Xcode project and must be operational before Phase 1 can be fully verified. Start pipeline setup in parallel with Phase 1 implementation.
- [Phase 3 flag]: Research phase recommended before planning — background audio + location + SpeechAnalyzer interactions on iOS 26, interruption handling behavior
- [Phase 4 flag]: Research phase recommended before planning — @Generable schema design, FlightSummaryBuilder token budget strategy with real flight transcripts
